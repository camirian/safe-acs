# Self-Audit Checklist

- [x] **Zero-Drift & Traceability:** MBSE (SysML v2) to code (Pydantic) synchronization strictly mapped in Architecture parameters.
- [x] **Safety & Guardrails:** Edge-compute constraints explicit; Bimodal Decision Protocol (Type 1 vs Type 2) firmly structured.
- [x] **Edge-Compute Priority:** NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano topology assigned correctly for deterministic execution layer.
- [x] **Formatting Requirements:** Six artifacts presented in clean Markdown. Mermaid diagrams detached from tables. No nested Mermaid components.
- [x] **Standards Fulfillment:** Integrated definitions mapping DO-178C, FAA OPA, IEEE 7000, NIST AI RMF, MIL-STD-882, and ISO/IEC 42001.
- [x] **Scope Control Maintained:** Restricted focus entirely to Phase 1 architecture definition; absolutely no application logic generated.
